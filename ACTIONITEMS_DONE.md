## Task 1: Project Setup and Structure ✅ COMPLETED

**Objective**: Set up the foundational project structure for the File Connector

**Tasks Completed**:
- ✅ Created Python project structure with proper directories
- ✅ Set up virtual environment and requirements.txt with all necessary dependencies
- ✅ Initialized git repository 
- ✅ Created basic configuration files (settings, logging, environment)
- ✅ Set up comprehensive logging infrastructure

**Implementation Details**:
- Created modular directory structure under `src/connector/` with separate packages for API clients, database, core logic, config, and utils
- Added comprehensive requirements.txt including Google Drive API, Autodesk APIs, async libraries, database tools, and testing frameworks
- Implemented type-safe configuration system using Pydantic with separate settings classes for each service
- Built structured logging system with JSON/console formatting, file rotation, and performance decorators
- Created main application entry point with async support and graceful shutdown handling
- Set up proper .gitignore, documentation, and example configuration files

**Git Commit**: dd768d8 - "Initial project setup: directory structure, configuration, and logging"

**Status**: Completed successfully - Ready to proceed with Task 2

## Task 2: Database Layer (Mock Supabase) ✅ COMPLETED

**Objective**: Implement comprehensive database layer for storing file metadata and sync operations

**Tasks Completed**:
- ✅ Created SQLAlchemy-based database models for endpoints, files, and sync logs
- ✅ Implemented repository pattern with full CRUD operations
- ✅ Added high-level service layer with transaction management 
- ✅ Built file synchronization with deduplication logic
- ✅ Implemented sync logging and status tracking
- ✅ Added database statistics and cleanup utilities

**Implementation Details**:

- **Database Management**: Connection pooling, session management, table creation, and connection testing
- **Testing**: Comprehensive test suite covering all database operations, including edge cases and error scenarios
- **Compatibility**: Fixed compatibility issues with Pydantic 2.x and SQLAlchemy 2.x versions

**Key Features**:
- Transaction management with automatic rollback on errors
- Performance monitoring with execution time logging
- Batch file processing for efficient sync operations
- Database statistics for monitoring and health checks
- Configurable database connections (SQLite for development, PostgreSQL for production)
- Type-safe operations using Pydantic models for validation

**Git Commit**: bcf62a8 - "Implement complete database layer with SQLAlchemy"

**Status**: Completed successfully - Ready to proceed with Task 3

## Task 3: API Client - Google Drive ✅ COMPLETED

**Objective**: Implement comprehensive Google Drive API client for file synchronization

**Tasks Completed**:
- ✅ Implemented Google Drive API client with service account authentication
- ✅ Created async file listing with pagination and rate limiting
- ✅ Built file type filtering and advanced query building
- ✅ Added file metadata extraction and conversion
- ✅ Implemented health checks and sync information
- ✅ Created extensible base API client architecture

**Implementation Details**:
- **Base Architecture**: Created abstract BaseAPIClient class with standard FileMetadata model for all API clients
- **Authentication**: Service account credentials with comprehensive error handling and validation
- **File Listing**: Async generator with automatic pagination, rate limiting, and thread pool execution
- **Filtering**: Advanced query building with date filters, folder restrictions, file type matching, and trash exclusion
- **Metadata Extraction**: Complete file information including links, dates, permissions, ownership, and sharing status
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive exception handling for API errors, rate limits, authentication failures
- **Performance**: Async execution with thread pool for API calls, execution time logging, and connection management
- **Testing**: Comprehensive mocked test suite covering authentication, filtering, metadata conversion, and error scenarios
- **Factory Pattern**: Extensible API client factory for easy addition of new service integrations

**Key Features**:
- Async generator architecture for memory-efficient file streaming
- Configurable file type filtering (extensions and MIME types)
- Date-based incremental sync support
- Folder-specific file listing with shared drive support
- Automatic pagination handling with configurable page sizes
- Rate limit handling with retry-after support
- Google Drive quota monitoring and reporting
- Health check functionality for monitoring
- Comprehensive logging with structured metadata

**API Capabilities**:
- List files with pagination from specific folders or entire drive
- Filter files by type, date modified, and folder location
- Extract complete file metadata including sharing permissions
- Generate appropriate download/view links for different file types
- Support for Google Workspace files with export link generation
- Handle both personal and shared Google Drive access

**Git Commit**: 7c205ac - "Implement Google Drive API client with comprehensive features"

**Status**: Completed successfully - Ready to proceed with Task 4
