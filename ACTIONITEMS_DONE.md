## Task 1: Project Setup and Structure ✅ COMPLETED

**Objective**: Set up the foundational project structure for the File Connector

**Tasks Completed**:
- ✅ Created Python project structure with proper directories
- ✅ Set up virtual environment and requirements.txt with all necessary dependencies
- ✅ Initialized git repository 
- ✅ Created basic configuration files (settings, logging, environment)
- ✅ Set up comprehensive logging infrastructure

**Implementation Details**:
- Created modular directory structure under `src/connector/` with separate packages for API clients, database, core logic, config, and utils
- Added comprehensive requirements.txt including Google Drive API, Autodesk APIs, async libraries, database tools, and testing frameworks
- Implemented type-safe configuration system using Pydantic with separate settings classes for each service
- Built structured logging system with JSON/console formatting, file rotation, and performance decorators
- Created main application entry point with async support and graceful shutdown handling
- Set up proper .gitignore, documentation, and example configuration files

**Git Commit**: dd768d8 - "Initial project setup: directory structure, configuration, and logging"

**Status**: Completed successfully - Ready to proceed with Task 2

## Task 2: Database Layer (Mock Supabase) ✅ COMPLETED

**Objective**: Implement comprehensive database layer for storing file metadata and sync operations

**Tasks Completed**:
- ✅ Created SQLAlchemy-based database models for endpoints, files, and sync logs
- ✅ Implemented repository pattern with full CRUD operations
- ✅ Added high-level service layer with transaction management 
- ✅ Built file synchronization with deduplication logic
- ✅ Implemented sync logging and status tracking
- ✅ Added database statistics and cleanup utilities

**Implementation Details**:
- **Models**: Created EndpointModel, FileModel, SyncLogModel with proper relationships and constraints
- **Repository Layer**: Implemented type-safe CRUD operations with comprehensive logging and error handling
- **Service Layer**: Built high-level business logic with transaction management and batch operations
- **File Synchronization**: Intelligent update-or-create logic based on external file IDs and timestamps for deduplication
- **Sync Tracking**: Complete audit trail of sync operations with success/failure tracking and performance metrics
- **Database Management**: Connection pooling, session management, table creation, and connection testing
- **Testing**: Comprehensive test suite covering all database operations, including edge cases and error scenarios
- **Compatibility**: Fixed compatibility issues with Pydantic 2.x and SQLAlchemy 2.x versions

**Key Features**:
- Transaction management with automatic rollback on errors
- Performance monitoring with execution time logging
- Batch file processing for efficient sync operations
- Database statistics for monitoring and health checks
- Configurable database connections (SQLite for development, PostgreSQL for production)
- Type-safe operations using Pydantic models for validation

**Git Commit**: bcf62a8 - "Implement complete database layer with SQLAlchemy"

**Status**: Completed successfully - Ready to proceed with Task 3
