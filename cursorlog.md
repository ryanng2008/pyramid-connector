# Cursor Log

## Agent Work Summary

### Task 1: Project Setup and Structure ✅
- Created complete Python project directory structure with proper package organization
- Set up virtual environment requirements with all necessary dependencies (Google Drive API, Autodesk APIs, async libraries, testing tools)
- Configured comprehensive logging infrastructure using structlog and colorlog
- Created application configuration system using Pydantic for type-safe settings
- Initialized git repository and committed initial project structure
- Set up example configuration files for endpoints and environment variables
- Created main application entry point with async support and graceful shutdown handling

```

### Key Files Added:
- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies including Google Drive API, async libraries, testing tools
- `src/connector/config/settings.py` - Type-safe configuration using Pydantic
- `src/connector/utils/logging.py` - Structured logging with JSON/console formats and performance decorators
- `src/connector/main.py` - Main application entry point with async support
- `README.md` - Comprehensive project documentation
- `.gitignore` - Proper Python/IDE ignore patterns
- `env.example` - Environment variable template
- `config/endpoints.example.json` - Example endpoint configuration

### Git Repository:
- Initialized git repository
- Committed initial project structure (commit: dd768d8)

### Task 2: Database Layer (Mock Supabase) ✅
- Implemented comprehensive SQLAlchemy-based database models for endpoints, files, and sync logs
- Created repository pattern with full CRUD operations and business logic
- Added high-level service layer with transaction management and error handling
- Built robust file synchronization with deduplication based on external file IDs and timestamps
- Implemented sync logging and status tracking for monitoring
- Added database statistics, cleanup utilities, and performance monitoring
- Successfully tested all database operations with comprehensive test suite
- Fixed compatibility issues with latest Pydantic 2.x and SQLAlchemy 2.x versions

### Database Features Implemented:
- **Models**: EndpointModel, FileModel, SyncLogModel with proper relationships
- **Repository Layer**: Type-safe CRUD operations with logging and error handling
- **Service Layer**: High-level business logic with transaction management
- **File Sync**: Intelligent update-or-create logic with timestamp-based deduplication
- **Sync Tracking**: Complete audit trail of sync operations with success/failure tracking
- **Performance**: Execution time logging, batch operations, and connection pooling
- **Testing**: Comprehensive test suite verifying all database functionality

### Git Repository:
- Initialized git repository
- Committed initial project structure (commit: dd768d8)
- Committed complete database layer (commit: bcf62a8)
